Firmware for serprog on a Teensy 3.1,
supports my hardware (see hardware/)
with LPC,FWH and SPI.

You'll need to modify the Makefile
to point to your teensy toolchain,
assumed to be still inside
arduino 1.0.6.

It might be possible to still
compile under cygwin on windows,
but this was only tested on linux.
