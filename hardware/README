There be the EAGLE files (.sch,.brd) here,
gerbers in the .zip.
And the board is also shared in oshpark:

It is actually a bit tricky to build,
but i managed it. Dont short the PLCC
pins to the pin holes and dont
push the pins through the holes,
just in the holes, because the PLCC
socket goes above them.
